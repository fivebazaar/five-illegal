## ⚙️ Script Workflow
The script consists of four stages: gathering, processing, packaging, and selling.

1. **🌱 Gathering:** Interact with plants in a fixed location to gather resources. If configured, a specific item may be required in your inventory to gather.

2. **⚗️ Processing:** Go to the configured location, interact, and complete the selected minigame to process the gathered materials.

3. **📦 Packaging:** Use the processed materials with an empty package in your inventory to package them.

4. **💰 Selling:** There are two ways to sell:
   - Interact with a fixed NPC location to sell your packages.
   - Walk around the Grove or Vinewood areas and interact with NPCs to sell directly.
